# GenAI Sandbox

Welcome to **GenAI Sandbox**! This repository is dedicated to my personal experiments and investigations in Generative AI (GenAI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Here, you'll find explorations, comparisons, and experiments related to different aspects of these technologies, with an open invitation to the community to engage, learn, and contribute.

### 1. [Comparison Between Single-Agent and Multi-Agent Approaches](./single_vs_multi_agent)

In this section, I've conducted experiments to compare the performance and outcomes of single-agent versus multi-agent systems in generative tasks. By diving into different use cases, such as collaborative text generation, problem-solving, or adversarial setups, the experiments reveal interesting contrasts between these approaches and aim to provide deeper insights into their respective strengths and weaknesses.
