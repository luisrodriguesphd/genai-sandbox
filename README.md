# GenAI Sandbox

Welcome to **GenAI Sandbox**! This repository is dedicated to my personal experiments and investigations in Generative AI (GenAI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Here, you'll find explorations, comparisons, and experiments related to different aspects of these technologies, with an open invitation to the community to engage, learn, and contribute.

## Experiments and Investigations
[Back to ToC](#toc)

Below is a list of the experiments and investigations included in this repository:

<a name="lab-1"/></a>
### 1. [Comparison Between Single-Agent and Multi-Agent Approaches](./single_vs_multi_agent)

This investigation aims to compare the effectiveness of single-agent versus multi-agent approaches for building an Article Writer app. It includes two notebooks that demonstrate each approach:
- Single-Agent Approach: Implemented using LangChain with a Research Tool and a Writing Tool, both utilizing LLMs.
- Multi-Agent Approach: Implemented using CrewAI with two agent executors (Researcher and Writer) working collaboratively.

The goal is to explore the capabilities, strengths, and limitations of each approach, and to determine whether a multi-agent system provides significant advantages over a single-agent setup.
